# InfinityPlus Datasource

InfinityPlus is a Grafana data source plugin based on the original [Grafana Infinity Datasource](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/yesoreyeram-infinity-datasource/). It extends the functionality of the original plugin with additional features while maintaining the core capabilities of visualizing data from JSON, CSV, XML, GraphQL, and HTML endpoints.
